# VI_inversion_WSB_TAM_JGRse

This GitHub repository contains the python code to prepare and evaluate “variation of information” joint inversion of gravity and magnetic data to recover density and susceptibility distribution in the area of the Transantarctic Mountains and the Wilkes Subglacial Basin. 
The resulting datasets are published through the UK Polar data centre
https://www.bas.ac.uk/data/uk-pdc/. The research article related to the data is submitted to the JGR solid earth and the preprint can be accessed at: https://essopenarchive.org/doi/full/10.22541/essoar.168987130.08453761/v1
